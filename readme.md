# C868 - Scripting And Programming - Applications

This is a project I did for my course at WGU! 

## Prompt:

>You must write a program containing two classes (i.e., Student and Roster). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program.

I was given a specific layout for everything so that's why something's are a bit redundant or don't make sense. 

Thanks for giving it a look!
